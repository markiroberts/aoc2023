#LR order LLR means Left Left Right then repeat
LR

#next node LR
11A = (11B, XXX)
11B = (XXX, 11Z)
11Z = (11B, XXX)
22A = (22B, XXX)
22B = (22C, 22C)
22C = (22Z, 22Z)
22Z = (22B, 22B)
XXX = (XXX, XXX)

#step 1
#first order is 'R'
#first node is 'AAA'
#first directions for node BBB, CCC
#so next node is CCC
#
#step 2
#order is 'L'
#node is 'CCC'
#directions for node ZZZ, GGG
#so next node is ZZZ
#
#reached goal after 2 steps
