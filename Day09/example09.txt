#LR order LLR means Left Left Right then repeat
RL

#next node LR
AAA = (BBB, CCC)
BBB = (DDD, EEE)
CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)
DDD = (DDD, DDD)
EEE = (EEE, EEE)
GGG = (GGG, GGG)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)

#step 1
#first order is 'R'
#first node is 'AAA'
#first directions for node BBB, CCC
#so next node is CCC
#
#step 2
#order is 'L'
#node is 'CCC'
#directions for node ZZZ, GGG
#so next node is ZZZ
#
#reached goal after 2 steps
